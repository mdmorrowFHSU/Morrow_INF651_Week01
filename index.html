     <p>I can not see why my hello world is not working</p>
     <p>I know my script link is working correctly</p>
     <p>Tried adding the styles from the starter program</p>
     <p>no dice.... I have to get my son in the bath and fed</p>
     <p>So I'll take the hit on the grade and figure out what is wrong with it when I can</p>
     <p>Already spent hours trying to figure this out</p>
     <p>I wish I had emailed you yesterday so when I got home from work</p>
     <p>I would have had an answer...</p>
